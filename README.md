This webscraper was created to collect data from the Cyberseek website. When the webscraper begins, it will instruct you to select a year on the website's dropdown menu, and then return to the terminal and press enter. You then ignore the program as it is developed to automatically collect the supply and demand ratio, job openings, and total employed for each state. You may recieve error messages in the log as the webscraper works. This is normal. It will collect all data as long as the website isn't interacted with. I hope you enjoy this tool and it helps with your research or creating other tools!
